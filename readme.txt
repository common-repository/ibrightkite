Post your Bright Kite location to your blog

== Description ==

This plugin grabs your bright location and displays it in a sidebar widget.

The choice at the moment is between a textual location, or a full-blown Google map. The map can be customised to a particular size or zoom, to suit your blog.

The map uses Google's static map API, so is converted to an image, no javascript required. For a Google map, you will need an API key, which can be obtained here: <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">create a Google Maps API key</a>

Your location can now be cached, to save reloading from BrightKite every time.
